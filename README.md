## Future Plans
- Character Cards...
    - ~~Create/Set Up Battle Card~~ *COMPLETE*
    - Create/Set Up Social Card
    - Debate whether or not adding a Link Card would be necessary
- Figure out a way to remove a Character from The Archive
    - *This should be easy enough, I just need to refresh myself on SQL language.*
- Figure out a way to look up Character & Chara IDs; maybe by Mun IDs?
    - *Hardest part will probably be organizing information into an embed.*
- Example Command to show...
    - Example Mun Card
    - Example Character Cards (Base, Battle, Social, etc)
