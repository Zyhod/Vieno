# Vieno: An Archiver for Roleplay Servers
Vieno is a bot made specifically for use in Roleplay Servers. At the moment, use of this bot is *very* exclusive to a small group of people.

## What's It Do?
Vieno can do a few things, but the main highlights that the bot was created for are:
- Creating an archive of muns and their characters.
- Rolls dice, with the ability to define reasons for rolls.
- Choose something from a list.
- Create turn orders.

## Why a Repository if it's Exclusive?
For a couple of reasons, really. The first being in case I want to make all this public, and the second being so I have a place to put information and such to show people.
