## Turn Order
To have Vieno decide a turn order, use: `v.turnorder <player> | <player> | ...`

Give Vieno a list of players (be it by name, emoji, or otherwise) and Vieno will shuffle the list to create a turn order.

- Can list any number of options for Vieno to choose from.
- Can be used in place of rolling for initiative.

## Roll
To roll dice, use: `v.roll <ndn> <modifier(optional)> <reason(optional)>`

When rolling dice, a couple things to note:
- Adding a `modifier`, of either '+' or '-', is optional and can be skipped over.
- Adding a `reason`, of any length, is optional and can be skipped.
- Depending on the number of dice you roll (1d, under 50d, over 50d), Vieno will respond differently.
