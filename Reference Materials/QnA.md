# Questions & Answers
For the most part, these are just questions I thought about while developing the bot that I figured I'd put into here.

## General Questions

### Q. Why'd you create a repository if Vieno is currently Exclusive?
For a couple of reasons, really. The first being in case I want to make all this public, and the second being so I have a place to put information, like this Q & A, somewhere to later show people.

### Q. What can Vieno do?
Vieno can do a few things, but the main highlights that the bot was created for are:
- Creating an archive of muns and their characters.
- Rolling dice, with the ability to define reasons for rolls.
- Choosing something from a given list.
- Creating turn orders (in place of Rolling Initiative)

## Character Questions

### Q. I want to use the same Character for different Instances/Roleplay Groups, what should I do?
Your best bet is to register a New Character for every Instance/Roleplay Group. This way you can keep information, such as Relationship Information, pertaining to specific Instances/Groups seperate.

*(Note) Remember, if registering for a Roleplay Group, make sure to register the character in the Roleplay Group's Server!*
